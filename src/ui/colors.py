"""ui/colors.py — Single source of truth for profit/loss color semantics and
heatmap intensity (docs/ui.md 1.1, 1.2).

The whole app follows one rule: PROFIT (blue) = gain/up, LOSS (red) =
loss/down (user direction, 2026-09-22, overriding the earlier Korean market
convention of red=up/blue=down). Before this module, widgets.py used
blue for large positive change rates and history_table.py used red for
positive P/L, so the same color flipped meaning within a single Universe row
and across tabs. Any cell that previously picked a background from a
hardcoded threshold ladder should compute it via heatmap_bg() instead.
