"""ui/ma_chart.py — StockMaLauncherMixin: open a StockMaDialog for a ticker
from a background StockMaThread, keeping the dialogs alive until closed.

Trading Universe and the former Strategy/Auto Trading tab each carried their
own copy of this (thread start, finished slot, WA_DeleteOnClose dialog, a list
of open dialogs pruned of already-deleted ones); UniverseTab is the only user
now. Requires ui.common.ThreadOwnerMixin on the same class for _track_thread().
