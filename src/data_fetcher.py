"""data_fetcher.py — Facade module for the data package.

Re-exports the names UI and thread code actually import, so they keep one
import location while `data/` stays free to move things between its layers.
Data access only: no strategy symbols belong here.

This module is the single re-export list (data/__init__.py holds none), and
tests patch the real implementation modules (`data.cache`, `data.history`,
`data.fx`, `data.collectors.*`) rather than names on this facade (roadmap
6-2a). Trimmed on 2026-09-19 from 79 names (most of them private cache
internals nobody outside `data/` used) to the ones below; add a name here
only when a caller outside `data/` needs it.
